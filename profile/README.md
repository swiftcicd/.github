## SwiftCICD

SwiftCICD is a CICD tool written entirely in Swift. That means it can take full advantage of the rich Swift ecosystem of tools, such as Swift Package Manager, to enable the kind of expressive, type-safe CICD actions you'd expect from a Swift tool. 

SwiftCICD is in early, active development. It is undergoing frequent rapid, breaking changes. Use at your own discretion for now. Feedback, issues, requests, and PRs are welcome!
